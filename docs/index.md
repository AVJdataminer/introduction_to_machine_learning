    Hopefully, nothing has been broken.

Lectures notes are prepared in [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), which is a Jupyter notebook environment running in the cloud and storing notebooks in Google Drive. It makes it easy to collaborate on a project in Jupyter notebooks and provides free computing power.

This website was created for your convenience. Feel free to use Jupyter notebooks though:
